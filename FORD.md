A hodgepodge of mathematical routines written in modern Fortran. It provides functions for statistics, linear algebra, interpolation, search and sorts, root finding, fourier transforms, and differential equations. Some routines have been parallelized.

This project's codename refers to [Guiseppe Peano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano), a prolific late 19th century mathematician who contributed much to set theory and mathematical logic, as well as the fields of calculus and differential equations. In perhaps his most famous contribution, Peano introduces the definition of the natural numbers in terms of sets, resulting in a set of axioms that have become a cornerstone in modern set theory and mathematical induction.
