# moran
A library of functions and subroutines built on models from "An Introduction to Theoretical and Computational Aerodynamics" (Jack Moran, 1984), developed mainly as a learning exercise. This library focuses mainly on solving problems in finite wing theory, and does not contain any more recently developed CFD models.

Written in Fortran 2008, using the gfortran compiler (v. 4.9.2).
